# Simple CPU Emulator

## Purpose:
 - Understand and compare assembly languages.
 - Explain how circuits are used to construct memory and processors.
 - Discuss performance techniques such as pipelining and out-of-order execution.
 - Compare and contrast different computer designs.
 - Write an assembler.
 - Emulate a simple CPU using a virtual machine.

## Architecture and Design:
The CPU architecture and instruciton format are shown below:
